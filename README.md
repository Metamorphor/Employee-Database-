# Database API with Python
 A basic employee database constructed using Python API and SQLite3 that allows for:
 
 Creation of an employee database,
 Multiple search queries,
 Multi-layer menu,
 Auto-creation of ID numbers and company emails,
 Update of all employee attributes,
 Deletion of records.
 
This was a project as part of my MSc Computer Science at The University of Bath Databases module and counted for just 10% of the module marks. Focus was to be made on readable code and robust functions.
